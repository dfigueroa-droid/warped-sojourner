Use these prompts in Google Stitch to generate the "Tethered Gravity" Android App.

## Prompt 1: Mission Control Dashboard
>
> Design a dark-mode, futuristic 'Mission Control' dashboard for an Android app using Jetpack Compose and Material3. The screen must have a top status bar indicating connection state (Red/Green). The main body should contain a specific list of 'Active Agent Tasks' displayed as Cards. Each card shows a Task ID, Status (Planning/Executing), and a visual progress bar. Use a color palette of Deep Space Blue (#0B0D17) and Neon Cyan (#00F0FF). Include a bottom navigation bar with icons for 'Tasks', 'Terminal', and 'Settings'.

## Prompt 2: Terminal Emulator
>
> Design a full-screen Terminal Emulator view in Jetpack Compose. Use a monospaced font (JetBrains Mono or Roboto Mono). The background must be pure black. Text lines should be varying shades of green and white to represent logs. Include a floating action button (FAB) in the bottom right for 'Stop Process'. Include a sticky text input field at the bottom, docked to the keyboard, for sending commands.

## Prompt 3: Artifact Viewer
>
> Design a Markdown viewer screen in Jetpack Compose. It should be capable of rendering headers, code blocks (with syntax highlighting background), and bullet points. At the bottom, place two large action buttons: 'Approve Plan' (Green) and 'Reject/Feedback' (Red).
